# CPE-301-Swamp-Cooler-Project
This is for CPE 301, our lab session is 301.1104


Our group name is the Overachievers. The group consists of Khang Vo, Kenneth Matthews, and Spencer Carter

A few key points:

The code is ran through Arduino IDE 2.0.3 so make sure that the version being used to test this code is up to date (i.e. do not use Arduino 1.8 for this project)

Each member of the team did fully participate in the design of the code. At first we were using airdrop to toss the code around. We will be commiting code that was assigned to each of us for our parts of the project.

This will consist of:

Kenneth Mathews:
- Code for Fan functionality
- Overall starting design of the code
- LCD screen display code

Khang Vo:
- LCD screen display code
- Code for water level

Spencer Carter
- Stepper Motor functionality
- Screen output (Serial output)
- Overall look of code


The push of the code may only be a single push of the code per person. Re-commiting may happen to any other updates to the code between now and the due date. 

There will be a seperate file done in document form that can be seen in this Git, as well as submitted through unr-campus for grading.
